# JSON-API
This page for information about json-api in commandline for more intuitive web-server managements.


## Descriptions :
* on initial version some server-providers are confused when integrating account creation in their web-server. so we add this for help the server-providers.
* ***DO NOT*** edit manually `/etc/noobzvpns/users_db.json` file when noobzvpns-service is running it can lead database broken or on-race condition. use the `noobzvpns` command-line instead.
* use `noobzvpns --json [action]` for get json output result. the `[action]` is described at page [README.MD](README.MD) for more information.
